# crayobois.ca

This web application is designed for a startup wood work company called Crayobois. The app will allow customers to create their own wooden
pen by choosing the material, the hardware, the hardware color and the style. Then, they will be able to add their new custom pen to their
shopping cart and proceed to checkout with paypal or create a new pen. 

Later on, we plan to implement a secure login/signup service with Firebase to enhance user experience.

Also, this website will include a Gallery which shows all sort of pictures from the company, a contact form and a landing page with an
'About' section.

For this application, we used the 'MERN' stack and plan on adding Firebase.
